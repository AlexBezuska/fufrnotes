# Navigation user stories

This describes intended navigation behavior for switching between the Notes view and Projects view (Projects not implemented yet).

## Top navigation (global)

- As a user, I can always see a top navigation control that lets me switch between:
  - Notes
  - Projects
- As a user, the current view is clearly indicated in the nav.
- As a user, switching views is a single, obvious action (one tap/click).
- As a user, the nav works well on both mobile and desktop without needing precise taps.

## Mobile-friendly behavior

- As a mobile user, the top nav remains accessible even when the sidebar is hidden.
- As a mobile user, switching views does not require opening a sidebar or scrolling to the top.

## Desktop-friendly behavior

- As a desktop user, the top nav remains visible and does not crowd the main editing area.

## Accessibility / usability

- As a keyboard user, I can reach the view switcher via Tab and activate it via Enter/Space.
- As a user, nav labels are plain text (no icon-only controls) so the destination is unambiguous.
