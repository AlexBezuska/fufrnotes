# Projects + lists user stories

This describes the intended behavior for a future Projects feature (not implemented yet).

## Projects

- As a user, I can create a project with:
  - a title,
  - a due date (optional),
  - an auto-set created date,
  - a description field that supports markdown.
- As a user, I can view a list of my projects.
- As a user, I can open a project to view its details (title, dates, description).
- As a user, I can edit a project’s title, due date, and markdown description.

## Lists (inside a project)

- As a user, I can create as many lists as I want within a project.
- As a user, I can view all lists for a project.

## Todo items (inside a list)

- As a user, I can add todo items to a list.
- As a user, for each todo item, I can set either:
  - a one-time due date, or
  - a recurring date/time schedule.
- As a user, I can add/edit markdown notes for each todo item.
- As a user, I can view a list’s todo items along with their due/recurring schedule and notes.
